Informal Negotiations
To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Legal Terms (each a "Dispute" and collectively, the "Disputes") brought by either you or us (individually, a "Party" and collectively, the "Parties"), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal
negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.
Binding Arbitration
If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the American Arbitration Association (AAA) website. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, we will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may
be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in New York
County, New York, New York. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in New York County, New York, New York, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non convenient with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act
(UCITA) are excluded from these Legal Terms.</p>
<p>In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Services be commenced more than one (1) years after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for
jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
Restrictions
The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of
the general public or any other persons.
Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration
The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to
be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
Arbitration Opt-Out (30 Days). You may opt out of binding arbitration and the class/representative action waiver below by sending an email to info@thefaterebel.com with subject line “Arbitration Opt-Out,” your full name, and the email used for your account, within 30 days of the first date you accepted these Legal Terms.
Opting out does not affect other terms.
Mass-Arbitration Management (25+ / 90 Days). If 25 or more substantially similar arbitration demands are filed or threatened within any 90 day period by the same counsel or coordinated groups, the Parties agree:
(i) to batch and resolve 10 bellwether matters first; (ii) all others are stayed and statutes of limitation are tolled; (iii) after the bellwethers, the Parties will engage in good faith mediation and discuss reasonable batching or a global framework; (iv) no arbitration fees beyond filing fees will be due for stayed matters until each is activated;
and (v) the arbitrator(s) may enforce this administrative sequence. This paragraph is intended to increase efficiency and lower aggregate costs while preserving individual claim values.
Class/Representative Action Waiver; Non-Aggregation. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Disputes must be brought in your and our individual capacities only, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, private attorney general, or mass action. The arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim(s).
Litigation Funding Disclosure; No Control; No Assignment. If a third party is funding, indemnifying, or otherwise financing your fees or costs in connection with a Dispute, you agree to confidentially disclose the existence and nature of such arrangement to the arbitrator and to us (subject to any protective order). Any such
funder may not direct or control litigation/arbitration strategy or settlement. To the maximum extent permitted by law, you may not assign or sell any claim relating to the Services to any third party.</p>
