law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will
require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which
users have an account with us.
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information,
we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example,
because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will

deletion is possible.</p>
<p>9. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE? In Short: We aim to protect your personal
information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.
We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security
measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process.
However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic
transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be
100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other
unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect,
access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your
personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at
your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

<p>11. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS? In Short: Depending on your state of residence in
the US or in some regions, such as Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to
and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your
account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.
In some regions (like Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection
laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal
information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your
personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to
automated decision-making. If a decision that produces legal or similarly significant effects
is made solely by automated means, we will inform you, explain the main factors, and offer
a simple way to request human review. In certain circumstances, you may also have the
right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request
by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU
CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.
We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection
laws.
Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal
information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable
law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your
consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section
"HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.
However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its
withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal
information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
Account Information If you would at any time like to review or change the information in
your account or terminate your account, you can: Log in to your account settings and
update your user account. Users can update or delete their accounts at any time through
the in-app account settings. If you forget your password, you can use the “Reset Password”
feature after logging in. If you are unable to access your account, you may contact us using
the information provided. Legal documentation is only required in special cases, such as
law enforcement requests or the account holder’s death. Contact us using the contact
information provided. Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or
delete your account and information from our active databases. However, we may retain
some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any
investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.
In-app account deletion: You can delete your account at any time in Settings → Account →
Delete Account. When you do, associated profile data is removed from production systems;
backups and server logs purge on a scheduled cycle (typically within 90 days) subject to
legal retention.
If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at
.</p>
<p>12. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES Most web browsers and some mobile
operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or
setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology
standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do
not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a
revised version of this Privacy Notice.
California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals.
Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.</p>

resident of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky,
Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode
Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, or Virginia, you may have the right to request access to
